## This is github hosted page about me :)

Steps to setting up for Github pages:
1. Follow [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to setting up and know how Jekyll works. This includes: 
    - Liquid - Objects, Tags, Filters
    - Front Matter -  Is used to set variables for the page
    - Layouts - Markdown/HTML supported
    - Includes - Navigation between pages
    - Assets - CSS,images,js
    - ...
2. To add styling using supported themes, reference [this Github tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll). If not using supported themes, freely use Bootstrap or any other styling libraries.
